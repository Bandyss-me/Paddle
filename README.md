This is a classic game of paddle and it is one of my favorite projects I have created so far. This project was made for practicing my programing skills but it turned out way better than I was expecting.
The game was made in unity 6. 
There are 20 levels and 10 secret levels. The button to acces those secret levels is in the botoom right corner of the main menu.
I have a playable build for windows on itch.io (https://bandys.itch.io/paddle). To play it, you need to install the .zip file, extract it and play the .exe file. Windows may try to stop you, but you can avoid that by clicking "more information" and then "run anyway".
